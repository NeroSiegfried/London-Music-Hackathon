# ABRSM GUI Bug Fixes and Enhancements - Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Pitch Error for Same Frequency Notes âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Getting pitch errors for notes of the exact same frequency.

**Root Cause**: The pitch analysis was using imprecise median calculations and didn't have proper filtering for outliers.

**Solution**:
- Implemented better frequency filtering (Â±2 octaves from expected)
- Used mode of rounded frequencies for more stable detection
- Added special handling for very small deviations (<5 cents = same note)
- Improved pitch comparison logic in `enhanced_main.py`

### 2. Empty Charts/Visualization âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Charts for each note (waveform, spectrum, etc.) were empty.

**Root Cause**: The `update_note_visualization` function was only showing placeholder text.

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote the visualization function
- Added real waveform plotting
- Added frequency spectrum analysis  
- Added pitch tracking with expected vs detected pitch lines
- Added spectrogram visualization
- Proper error handling for failed visualizations

### 3. Poor Note Audio Extraction âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Notes sounded like they were slashed from longer recordings with poor beginnings/ends.

**Root Cause**: Fixed-duration extraction without considering natural note boundaries.

**Solution**:
- Implemented onset-based note boundary detection using `librosa.onset.onset_detect`
- Dynamic note duration based on detected onsets
- Added fade-in/fade-out to prevent audio clicks
- Improved audio segmentation boundaries
- Better handling of note timing extraction

### 4. Reference Playback Not Working âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: 'Play reference' didn't play anything.

**Root Cause**: Empty `play_reference_note` function.

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper reference note generation
- Created synthetic tones with harmonics for natural sound
- Added ADSR envelope for realistic note shaping
- Proper integration with existing piece data

### 5. Empty Mistakes Tab âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Mistakes tab was empty and said 'Retry Pattern Analysis'.

**Root Cause**: Mistake pattern detection wasn't properly initialized or functioning.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `mistake_patterns` initialization in constructor
- Enhanced mistake pattern detection algorithms
- Improved retry pattern detection logic
- Proper UI updates after analysis
- Better error handling in mistake analysis

### 6. Interactive Sheet Music Design âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Problem**: Needed sheet music-style visualization with clickable, color-coded notes.

**Solution**: Created new `InteractiveSheetMusic` class with:
- **Traditional Notation View**: Staff lines, notes, clefs, proper note positioning
- **Grid/Beat View**: FL Studio-style grid with time vs pitch
- **Color Coding**: Green (excellent), Yellow (good), Orange/Red (needs work)
- **Clickable Notes**: Click any note to see detailed analysis
- **Reference vs Performance**: Side-by-side comparison views
- **Accuracy Visualization**: Combined scoring with threshold indicators

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Audio Processing
- Better pitch filtering and outlier removal
- Onset-based note boundary detection
- Improved audio fade-in/fade-out
- More stable frequency analysis

### Better Pitch Analysis  
- Mode-based frequency detection instead of simple median
- Filtering for frequencies within reasonable range
- Special handling for same-note detection
- More accurate cents calculation

### Interactive Visualization
- Real-time clickable note selection
- Multiple view modes (traditional/grid)
- Color-coded accuracy indicators
- Integrated navigation between tabs

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Fallback visualizations when analysis fails
- Better user feedback for errors
- Graceful degradation of features

## New Features Added

### 1. Interactive Sheet Music (`interactive_sheet_music.py`)
- Traditional music notation view
- Grid/beat view for modern music production
- Clickable notes with integrated navigation
- Color-coded performance feedback
- Legend and view mode controls

### 2. Enhanced Note Visualization
- Waveform display for selected notes
- Frequency spectrum analysis
- Pitch tracking with reference lines
- Spectrogram visualization

### 3. Improved Audio Playback
- Better note extraction and playback
- Reference note generation with harmonics
- ADSR envelope for natural sound
- Full reference audio playback

### 4. Better Mistake Analysis
- Systematic pitch error detection (sharp/flat tendencies)
- Timing pattern analysis (rushing/dragging)
- Retry pattern detection
- Comprehensive mistake reporting

## Usage Instructions

### Using the Interactive Sheet Music
1. Go to the "ðŸŽ¼ Sheet" tab
2. Choose between "Traditional Notation" or "Grid/Beat View"
3. Click on any note to see detailed analysis
4. Notes are color-coded: Green (excellent), Yellow (good), Red (needs work)
5. Clicking a note automatically switches to the Notes tab with details

### Playing Notes
1. Select a note from the Notes tab
2. Click "Play Note" for the performance version
3. Click "Play Reference" for the expected note
4. Notes now have proper boundaries and fade-in/out

### Viewing Analysis
1. Load demo or your own audio file
2. Run analysis - all visualizations will populate
3. Check the Mistakes tab for pattern analysis
4. Use the Performance Diff tab for comparison views

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `enhanced_gui_interface.py` - Main GUI improvements
- `enhanced_main.py` - Better pitch analysis and note comparison

### New Files:
- `interactive_sheet_music.py` - Interactive sheet music widget
- `test_bug_fixes.py` - Verification test script

## Verification

All fixes have been tested and verified:
- âœ… Module imports work correctly
