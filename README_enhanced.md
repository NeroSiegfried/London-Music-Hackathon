## 🤖 LLM Training and AI Integration

### Training an LLM for Music Assessment

The ABRSM dataset provides an excellent foundation for training specialized music assessment models. Here's how to leverage the sample data:

#### **1. Data Preparation from ABRSM Dataset**

```python
# Extract training features from the ABRSM feedback data
def prepare_training_data(csv_file):
    """
    Convert ABRSM feedback into structured training data
    """
    import pandas as pd
    
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
    training_examples = []
    
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        # Extract performance metrics (would come from our analysis)
        performance_features = {
            "age_group": row['age_group'],
            "ability_group": row['ability_group'],
            "pieces": [
                {"title": row['title_piece_1'], "composer": row['composer_piece_1']},
                {"title": row['title_piece_2'], "composer": row['composer_piece_2']}
            ],
            "mark": row['mark'],
            # These would be generated by our analysis system:
            "pitch_accuracy": None,  # From our analyzer
            "timing_accuracy": None,  # From our analyzer
            "technical_issues": [],   # From our mistake detection
            "musical_interpretation": {}  # From our analysis
        }
        
        # Professional feedback as training target
        training_examples.append({
            "input": performance_features,
            "target_feedback": row['feedback'],
            "target_score": row['mark']
        })
    
    return training_examples
```

#### **2. Few-Shot Learning with GPT/Gemini**

```python
def create_music_assessment_prompt(performance_data, examples_from_abrsm):
    """
    Create effective prompts using ABRSM examples for few-shot learning
    """
    
    prompt = """You are an ABRSM music examiner with years of experience providing constructive feedback to students. Your feedback should be encouraging yet precise, identifying specific technical and musical areas for improvement.

EXAMPLE ASSESSMENTS FROM ABRSM DATASET:

Example 1:
Performance: Grade 5 Piano, Age 13-15, Pieces: "Alla Turca" by Mozart, "Under the Dreaming Cherry Tree" by Eri Kiyama
Mark: 83/100
Feedback: "'Alla Turca' started with a light and clear tone which was maintained across the course of the piece. Semiquavers were evenly played for the majority, their articulation precise, and most of the wider dynamic contrasts were defined. The quieter playing in the episodes saw small blemishes of evenness, and pitch centring in the octaves was not consistently secure, with some confidence lost towards the end..."

Example 2:
Performance: Up to Grade 5, Age 10-12, Pieces: "Invention No 8 in F Major" by Bach, "Love Theme" by Catherine Rollin  
Mark: 85/100
Feedback: "The first piece began with clean, crisp lines and the hands worked well together, with phrases arching and well articulated. Occasionally there was scope for even tighter rhythmic control and for the playing to be even more vibrant..."

def augment_training_data(base_examples):
    """
    Create synthetic training examples by varying performance parameters
    """
    augmented_data = []
    
    for example in base_examples:

            modify_performance_errors(example, focus="pitch"),
            # Timing-focused errors  
            modify_performance_errors(example, focus="timing"),
            # Combined technical issues

   • Systematic Issues: 2 patterns detected
   • Retry Attempts: 1 potential restart detected
   • Section Analysis: Performance consistency varies by section

🎯 YOUR PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK
==================================================
Great job on your performance! You maintained a steady rhythm throughout most of the piece and your pitch accuracy was quite good. I particularly noticed your strong beat placement in the first half.

For your next practice session, focus on the timing in measures 3-4 where you rushed slightly, and work on the pitch accuracy in the final phrase where a couple notes were a bit flat. The visual analysis shows exactly where to concentrate your practice.

Keep up the excellent work - your musical expression is developing beautifully!
